### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Theron Tyler
#### Aspiring Engineer and Programmer
My name is Theron Tyler. I am an 11th grader attending Henley High School in Klamath Falls, Oregon. I am 16 years old and a Henley Robotics and Engineering program member. This is my fourth year participating in the VEX Robotics Competition. My first year of VEX was at Henley Middle School. I am incharge of our team's code, I also help Document and scout for our team. Outside of participating in robotics, I am on Henley High Schoolâ€™s Football, Track, and Golf team. I also wrestled during my freshman year of high school. My personal goal for the season of VEX is to increase my proficiency in C++ and learn to code and implement different sensors in a VEX Robotics setting. Other goals of mine include increasing my proficiency in CAD, improving my teamwork skills, decreasing my habits of procrastination, and maintaining my 4.0 GPA. My primary goal for this robotics season is to attend VEX Worlds. After high school, I hope to study mechanical engineering and obtain my masters degree in that field. I would also like to get into the Investment Banking and Real Estate Investment world.

Skills: C++ / Videography / Video Editing / Autodesk Inventor
